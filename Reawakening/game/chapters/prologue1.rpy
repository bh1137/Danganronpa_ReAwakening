    hkmonologue "Sanctioned by the government, this private high school was founded to develop and research the talents of exceptional teenagers,"
    hkmonologue "who would come be known as {color=#efcc00}{b}Ultimates{/b}{/color}."
    hkmonologue "It didn't matter how mundane your ability was."
    hkmonologue "As long as you were the best in your field, you were considered worthy of the title {color=#efcc00}{b}Ultimate{/b}{/color}."
    hkmonologue "From the Ultimate Doctor to the Ultimate Competitive Eater: whatever your ability was, Hope's Peak wanted you."
    hkmonologue "They say that if you graduated from Hope's Peak, you were set for the rest of your life."
    hkmonologue "Income, housing, relationships, family life, all taken care of."
    hkmonologue "A life truly worth living."

    # INTRODUCE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE REJECTS 
    hkmonologue "Now, what happen if you had an Ultimate ability, but lost your chance to succeed at life?"
    hkmonologue "You might be asking yourself, \"How do you lose a chance to attend such a prestigious institution?\""
    hkmonologue "Well, there could be a lot of reasons."
    hkmonologue "Maybe they were already on top of the world and didn't really want the added stress of schooling."
    hkmonologue "Maybe they were denied from attending due to poor grades or even not having a fully developed talent."
    hkmonologue "Or maybe...their reputation was tarnished and their acceptance was rescinded."
    hkmonologue "Whatever the circumstance may be, there are many people in this world that are still considered {color=#efcc00}{b}Ultimates{/b}{/color}, but are stuck in limbo."
    hkmonologue "If the whole point of Hope's Peak was to help use the talents of the gifted few to better themselves and society..."
    hkmonologue "...then why does it only take one failure to lose the title of {color=#efcc00}{b}Ultimate{/b}{/color}?" 
    hkmonologue "With so many people and so many talents available..."
    hkmonologue "...Why wouldn't they want to find a way to use their talents to change the world as well?"
    hkmonologue "I mean, it only takes one person's actions to change the world."

    # HOPE'S PEAK UNIVERSITY 
    hkmonologue "With the increasing amount of untapped potential, the government decided to sanction another school, this time, a college."
    hkmonologue "This university was meant to give older individuals with {color=#efcc00}{b}Ultimates{/b}{/color} a chance at redemption:"
    hkmonologue "A second chance at bettering themselves by gaining the same level education those who attended the Academy did."
    hkmonologue "With an institution designed to give second chances, you'd think the government would give the school a matching title, right?"
    hkmonologue "Not really, but on the other hand, the name still has a nostalgic tone to it!"
    hkmonologue "The school's name..."

    # SHOW UNIVERSITY
    show university_overhead with Dissolve(1.2)
    hkmonologue "{color=#efcc00}{b}Hope's Peak University{/b}{/color}."

    # TALK ABOUT IT 
    hkmonologue "Now the University is actually superior to the Academy in several ways."
    hkmonologue "First: since it is a college campus, more money was able to be procured and allocated."
    hkmonologue "This resulted in high-tech, state-of-the-art facilities, tailored to one's particular ability."
    hkmonologue "If accepted into the program, the university works alongside you to help sharpen and hone your potential {color=#efcc00}{b}Ultimate!{/b}{/color}"
    hkmonologue "Second: there is no age cap to attend the university."
    hkmonologue "It doesn't matter how old you are, as long you are an {color=#efcc00}{b}Ultimate{/b}{/color} who is in dire need of a second chance, you are eligible to apply."
    
    # HARD TO APPLY
    hkmonologue "There is, however, a caveat."
    hkmonologue "Hope's Peak University is listed as the hardest school to be accepted by in the country."
    hkmonologue "With this university, the concept of scouting doesn't exist."
    hkmonologue "It is purely based on the individual's circumstances that led them to applying in the first place."
    hkmonologue "And I would highly advise against lying on your application."
    hkmonologue "Consider that free legal advice."
    hide university_overhead with Dissolve(0.65)
    hkmonologue "Remember, the school is funded by the government, so in order to make sure their money is being used properly..."
    hkmonologue "...They want to make sure the accepted students will produce some return-on-investment."
    hkmonologue "As a result, the government has surveillance on every potential {color=#efcc00}{b}Ultimate{/b}{/color} documented, tracking their every move and action."
    hkmonologue "These records, along with each student's application, are used to judge who is deserving of a second chance at life."
